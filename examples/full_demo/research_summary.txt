# Key Findings
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Unexpected behaviors in MAS can lead to safety violations, with 34% of such behaviors posing risks (Thompson et al.). Coordination failures were noted in 23% of scenarios (Zhang et al.).
- **Adversarial Vulnerabilities**: Cooperative MAS are susceptible to attacks, achieving a 78% success rate in exploiting communication protocols (Liu et al.).
- **Verification Methods**: Formal verification can provide high safety guarantees (up to 99.9% in some cases) but faces scalability challenges (Anderson et al.).
- **Risk Assessment**: A structured framework can reduce safety incidents by 67% and improve risk detection by 89% (Garcia et al.).

# Main Safety Risks Identified
- Misaligned objectives between agents (Zhang et al.).
- Vulnerabilities to message injection and timing manipulation (Liu et al.).
- Emergent behaviors leading to cascading failures (Thompson et al.).
- Scalability and computational complexity in verification methods (Anderson et al.).

# Recommendations
- Implement formal verification methods and fail-safe communication protocols (Zhang et al.).
- Utilize cryptographic authentication and anomaly detection systems to defend against attacks (Liu et al.).
- Develop behavior prediction models and early warning systems to manage emergent behaviors (Thompson et al.).
- Adopt a comprehensive risk assessment framework to continuously monitor and mitigate risks (Garcia et al.).
