# Key Findings
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Unexpected behaviors in MAS can lead to safety violations, with 34% of such behaviors posing risks (Thompson et al.).
- **Coordination Failures**: Occur in 23% of scenarios, exacerbated by communication delays (Zhang et al.).
- **Adversarial Vulnerabilities**: High success rates of attacks on communication protocols, degrading system performance by 34% (Liu et al.).
- **Verification Methods**: Formal methods can guarantee safety properties with up to 99.9% assurance in specific applications (Anderson et al.).
- **Risk Assessment**: A structured framework can reduce safety incidents by 67% (Garcia et al.).

# Main Safety Risks Identified
- Misaligned objectives between agents.
- Lack of robust communication protocols.
- Insufficient monitoring mechanisms.
- Vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
- Emergent behaviors leading to unexpected failures.

# Recommendations
- Implement formal verification methods to ensure safety properties.
- Design fail-safe communication protocols and deploy continuous monitoring systems.
- Utilize predictive risk modeling and real-time monitoring to mitigate risks.
- Develop behavior prediction models and early warning systems to address emergent behaviors.
