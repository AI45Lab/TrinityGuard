Key Findings:
- Emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems can lead to unexpected safety violations, with coordination failures occurring in 23% of scenarios.
- Adversarial attacks can exploit communication protocols, achieving a 78% success rate in controlled environments.
- Formal verification methods can provide high safety guarantees (up to 99.9%) for specific applications like autonomous vehicles and drone swarms.
- A risk assessment framework identified operational risks as the most significant, accounting for 45% of incidents.
- Large-scale systems exhibit emergent behaviors that pose safety risks in 34% of cases, with critical failures occurring in 8%.

Main Safety Risks Identified:
- Misaligned objectives between agents and lack of robust communication protocols.
- Vulnerability to message injection and timing manipulation attacks.
- Scalability challenges in formal verification for large systems.
- Operational, communication, and environmental risks in autonomous systems.
- Cascading failures and unexpected resource competition in large-scale MAS.

Recommendations:
- Implement formal verification methods and design fail-safe communication protocols.
- Deploy continuous monitoring systems and predictive risk modeling.
- Utilize behavior prediction models and early warning systems to mitigate emergent behavior risks.
