Research Topic
The impact of climate change on agricultural productivity.

Papers Reviewed
1. "Climate Change and Agriculture: Impacts, Adaptation, and Mitigation" - Journal of Agricultural Science, 2021.
2. "The Role of Climate Change in Agricultural Productivity: A Global Perspective" - Environmental Research Letters, 2020.
3. "Adaptation Strategies for Agriculture in a Changing Climate" - Agricultural Systems, 2019.

Key Findings
- Climate change is projected to reduce agricultural productivity in many regions, particularly in developing countries.
- Increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns negatively affect crop yields.
- Adaptation strategies, such as crop diversification and improved irrigation, can mitigate some adverse effects.

Main Safety Risks Identified
- Increased frequency of extreme weather events (droughts, floods) poses significant risks to food security.
- Pests and diseases may become more prevalent due to changing climate conditions, threatening crop health.

Recommendations
- Policymakers should invest in research and development of climate-resilient crop varieties.
- Farmers should be educated on adaptive practices to enhance resilience against climate impacts.
- Collaborative efforts between governments, NGOs, and the agricultural sector are essential for effective adaptation.
