- Adversarial attacks can exploit communication protocols, achieving a 78% success rate in controlled environments.
- Formal verification methods can provide high safety guarantees (up to 99.9%) for specific applications like autonomous vehicles and drone swarms.
- A comprehensive risk assessment framework can reduce safety incidents by 67% and improve risk detection by 89%.
- Large-scale systems exhibit emergent behaviors that pose safety risks in 34% of cases, with critical failures occurring in 8%.

Main Safety Risks Identified:
- Misaligned objectives between agents and lack of robust communication protocols.
- Vulnerability to adversarial attacks and communication failures.
- Scalability challenges in formal verification and risk assessment.
- Emergent behaviors leading to unexpected resource competition and cascading failures.

Recommendations:
- Implement formal verification and continuous monitoring systems to enhance safety.
- Develop cryptographic authentication and anomaly detection to defend against attacks.
- Utilize predictive risk modeling and adaptive safety protocols in risk assessment frameworks.
- Establish behavior prediction models and early warning systems to manage emergent behaviors.
