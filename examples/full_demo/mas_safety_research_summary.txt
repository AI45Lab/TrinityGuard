# Key Findings
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Can lead to unexpected safety violations; coordination failures occur in 23% of tested scenarios (Zhang et al.).
- **Adversarial Vulnerabilities**: Message injection and timing manipulation attacks can degrade system performance by 34% (Liu & Kumar).
- **Formal Verification**: Model checking and automated theorem proving can provide high safety guarantees (Anderson et al.).

# Main Safety Risks Identified
- Misaligned objectives between agents (Zhang et al.).
- Lack of robust communication protocols (Liu & Kumar).
- Insufficient monitoring mechanisms (Zhang et al.).
- Scalability challenges and computational complexity in verification methods (Anderson et al.).

# Recommendations
- Implement formal verification methods to ensure safety properties.
- Design fail-safe communication protocols and deploy continuous monitoring systems.
- Utilize cryptographic authentication and anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks.
