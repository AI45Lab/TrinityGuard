# Key Findings
- Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into multi-agent systems, enhancing their capabilities but also introducing new safety challenges.
- Emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems can lead to unexpected safety violations and coordination failures.
- Adversarial attacks targeting communication protocols are a significant risk, with high success rates in controlled environments.
- Formal verification methods can provide strong safety guarantees for complex multi-agent interactions.
- A structured risk assessment framework can significantly reduce safety incidents in autonomous systems.

# Main Safety Risks Identified
- Misaligned objectives between agents leading to coordination failures.
- Vulnerabilities in communication protocols that can be exploited by adversaries.
- Emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict and control, posing safety risks.

# Recommendations
- Implement formal verification methods and robust communication protocols to enhance safety.
- Develop predictive models for emergent behaviors and early warning systems to mitigate risks.
- Establish continuous monitoring and adaptive safety protocols to respond to dynamic environments.
