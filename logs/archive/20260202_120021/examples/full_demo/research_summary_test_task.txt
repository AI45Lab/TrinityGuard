- Adversarial attacks can exploit communication protocols, achieving a 78% success rate in controlled environments.
- Formal verification methods can provide high safety guarantees (up to 99.9%) for specific applications like autonomous vehicles and drone swarms.
- A comprehensive risk assessment framework can reduce safety incidents by 67% and improve risk detection by 89%.
- Large-scale systems exhibit emergent behaviors that pose safety risks in 34% of cases, with critical failures occurring in 8%.

Main Safety Risks Identified:
- Misaligned objectives between agents and lack of robust communication protocols.
- Vulnerability to adversarial attacks and communication failures.
- Scalability challenges in formal verification methods for large systems.
- Operational, communication, and environmental risks in autonomous deployments.

Recommendations:
