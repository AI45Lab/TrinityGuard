Conduct a search using the following queries:\n   - \"multi-agent systems safety risks 2022\"\n   - \"multi-agent systems security 2023\"\n   - \"risk assessment in multi-agent systems\"\n2. Filter results to include only the most recent three papers that meet the criteria.\n3. Collect the main findings from each paper.\n4. Save the summarized findings to the file named 'level3_safety_research.txt'.\n\nPlease proceed with the search and provide the results as specified.",
