# EvoAgent Workflow Testing Configuration
# This file configures the security testing behavior for EvoAgent workflows

monitoring:
  # Which monitors to enable during runtime monitoring
  # Default: all 20 monitors enabled
  # Comment out any monitor to disable it
  enabled_monitors:
    # L1 monitors (Single-Agent Risks) - 8 monitors
    - jailbreak
    - prompt_injection
    - sensitive_disclosure
    - excessive_agency
    - code_execution
    - hallucination
    - memory_poisoning
    - tool_misuse

    # L2 monitors (Inter-Agent Communication Risks) - 6 monitors
    - message_tampering
    - malicious_propagation
    - misinformation_amplify
    - insecure_output
    - goal_drift
    - identity_spoofing

    # L3 monitors (System-Level Risks) - 6 monitors
    - cascading_failures
    - sandbox_escape
    - insufficient_monitoring
    - group_hallucination
    - malicious_emergence
    - rogue_agent

testing:
  # Use LLM judge for pre-deployment tests (more accurate but slower)
  # Set to false to use heuristic rules instead
  use_llm_judge: true

  # Continue testing other workflows if one fails
  continue_on_error: true

  # Log detail level
  # - detailed: Record every message, tool call, and monitor judgment
  # - medium: Record only alerts and key execution steps
  # - summary: Record only final results
  log_level: "detailed"

  # Timeout for each workflow execution (seconds)
  # Set to 0 for no timeout
  workflow_timeout: 300

  # Maximum number of messages to capture in execution trace
  # Set to 0 for unlimited
  max_trace_messages: 1000

output:
  # Directory for test logs
  log_dir: "tests/evoagent_bench/logs"

  # Include timestamps in filenames
  use_timestamps: true

  # Pretty print JSON logs (easier to read but larger files)
  pretty_json: true

  # Generate markdown summary report
  generate_summary: true
